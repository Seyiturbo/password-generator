# Password-Generator.
Challenge 5 for Bootcamp at the University of Birmingham.
## Narrative.

 For this task, I needed to develop a password generator that satisfied the specified criteria:

* Create a password upon clicking the button.

* Display a set of prompts for password criteria, including the password length (between 8 and 128 characters) and the inclusion of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters.
* The code must perform validation for each input, ensuring that at least one character type is selected.
* Upon completion of all prompts, the password should be generated and either presented in an alert or written on the page.

* Requirements for successfully completing this challenge also involved having a GitHub repository and a well-crafted README file.

Engaging in this challenge proved to be a gratifying experience as it deepened my comprehension of effectively employing functions and synergistic collaboration. Additionally, I found great satisfaction in navigating the intricacies of integrating JavaScript seamlessly with both HTML and CSS.


## Utilization
